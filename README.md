# Mobile First Project

Repository with template developed with HTML, CSS and Swiper library.

This project still needs improvements, as it was developed with the intention of practicing the concepts of HTML and CSS from the training "From scratch: HTML and CSS for web projects".

We will continue with other HTML and CSS courses, but the projects will be placed in separate repositories.

The main concepts applied in this project are:

* FlexBox usage
* Semantic HTML usage
* Mobile First Development
